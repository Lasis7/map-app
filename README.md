# AwesomeApp123
A map app that loosely borrows the idea of Pokemon GO. Move to the randomly generated targets on the map to collect points. The name AwesomeApp123 is a placeholder name until I come up with an actual name.

## History
This app originally started as the final assignment for Mobileapp development course. Therefor it is a PWA-application with offline support. After the course I decided to continue working on this project on my freetime, so I made its own repository for it. There is no commit history for the app, so I will just list the rough changelog below
